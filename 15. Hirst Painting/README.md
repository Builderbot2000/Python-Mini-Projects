# Hirst Painting
- In this project, I've tried turtle graphics(updated version of logo language studied in school)
- To get familiar with turtle module, I tried making a random path that makes each path with a random color.
- Next, I tried making a spirograph which is made through circle method of turtle library, rotated by random angles.
- Finally, I made a 10x10 Hirst Painting that makes each dot with a random color chosen from a predefined color palette(extracted from an image using colorgram.py module) using 'dot' method and resets to a point after making 10 dots on a 
line.
